## Target

The Target of the Repository is the easy deployment and managment of a Chatsystem for every one. So you can as a Client, just start a server or an old Computer that you dont need any more snd just fire the software up, configure the Ip and you are ready to go.

## Server

Here I will give you a overview of the Server Options you have to deploy the Chatsystem Database.

### Linux

### Windows

### Database

Mondo DB is the Database Software that I use for this Project because of the good compatability with Linux and Windows.
For more Information see [Docs](docs/Mongodb.md) or [Python Implementation](docs/database_docs.md).

## Usage

## Security

The security of the application is very important. The following are some of the security measures that have been implemented:

- **End to End Encryption**: The messages are encrypted before they are sent to the server. The server does not have access to the encryption keys, so it cannot decrypt the messages. This ensures that even if the server is compromised, the messages cannot be read by an attacker. [Read more](docs/CRYPT.md)
